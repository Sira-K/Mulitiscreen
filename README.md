# Multi-Screen Video Streaming Management System

A comprehensive, open-source solution for managing multi-screen video streaming systems with support for SRT protocol, Docker containerization, and real-time client management.

## Project Overview

This system enables organizations to create and manage video walls, digital signage networks, and multi-display streaming setups using recycled or heterogeneous displays. It's designed to be scalable, reliable, and easy to deploy across different hardware configurations.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-Screen Streaming**: Stream video content across multiple displays simultaneously
- **SRT Protocol Support**: Low-latency, reliable video streaming using SRT protocol
- **Client Management**: Real-time monitoring and control of streaming clients
- **Group Management**: Organize displays into logical groups for coordinated streaming
- **Video Management**: Upload, validate, and manage video content
- **Docker Integration**: Containerized deployment for easy scaling and management

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live status updates and performance metrics
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management and logging system
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute streaming load across multiple servers
- **Failover Support**: Automatic recovery and redundancy
- **API-First Design**: RESTful API for integration with external systems

## How It Works

### 1. System Setup
1. **Backend Server**: Deploy the Flask backend with Docker support
2. **Frontend Interface**: Access the React-based management interface
3. **Client Devices**: Install Python clients on Raspberry Pi or other devices

### 2. Client Registration
1. Clients connect to the server and register their display capabilities
2. Server assigns unique identifiers and tracks client status
3. Clients report their hardware specifications and streaming capabilities

### 3. Content Management
1. Upload video files through the web interface
2. System validates video format and creates streaming configurations
3. Content is organized into playlists and schedules

### 4. Streaming Operations
1. Create streaming groups by selecting displays and content
2. Configure streaming parameters (quality, protocol, synchronization)
3. Start streaming with real-time monitoring and control

### 5. Monitoring & Control
1. Real-time status updates for all clients and streams
2. Performance metrics and error reporting
3. Remote control capabilities for troubleshooting
