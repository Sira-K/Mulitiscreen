## Error Handling Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always use specific error codes** instead of generic messages
2. **Include relevant context** in error responses (file paths, configuration values, etc.)
3. **Log detailed error information** for debugging while returning user-friendly messages
4. **Implement retry logic** for transient errors (network timeouts, resource exhaustion)
5. **Validate inputs early** to catch configuration errors before processing

### For System Administrators

1. **Monitor error frequency** and patterns to identify systemic issues
2. **Set up automated alerts** for critical error categories (5xx system errors)
3. **Maintain error logs** with sufficient detail for troubleshooting
4. **Document common resolution steps** for your specific environment
5. **Test error scenarios** during maintenance windows to verify monitoring

### For Users

1. **Check error code documentation** before contacting support
2. **Include error codes and context** when reporting issues
3. **Try suggested solutions** in order of likelihood
4. **Check system status** and network connectivity first
5. **Keep logs and screenshots** of error conditions for troubleshooting
